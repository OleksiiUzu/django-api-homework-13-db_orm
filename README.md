# Django - creating API

## About
This repository is my thirdteenth homework assignment from the Python Pro course. This is my first introduction to the Django framework.
I will make web-site that calls pet-shelter. Tha main idea for this site is to allow users to schedule visits with animals in a shelter. 
The platform enables potential adopters to browse available pets and book appointments to meet them in person.

Added some functional to the apps, like:
- Reding from DB
- Database entry for login, logout, registration, blog, animal pages

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/OleksiiUzu/django-api-homework-13-db-orm.git

2.(Optional) Create and activate a virtual environment:
  python -m venv venv
  source venv/bin/activate
